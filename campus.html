											Think you have a few hours to contribute to programs outside college? Being a campus ambassador or a campus expert is the best way to help your college communities in addition to building connections and enriching your skill-set. Such groups are very supportive- starting from resources to sponsoring events! Having been a GeeksforGeeks Campus Ambassador for my college, I was a part of a super friendly and interactive community with encouraging mentors. Here ’s a curated list of few campus ambassador programs that you could apply for. </br>
											<i>Note: Some of the application links are closed as the year is coming to an end. But that shouldn’t keep you from applying for the coming year. </i></br></br>

											<h2>HackerRank</h2>
											<blockquote>“You are the face, voice and evangelist of HackerRank at your campus”</blockquote> 

											The <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/campus-ambassador-program">HackerRank Student Ambassador Program</a> enables student coders and leaders to establish a coding community on campus and host coding contests on HackerRank. In addition to promoting signature competitions like the HackerRank World Cup, the individual gets to connect with a global group of ambassadors. Also, there’s no dearth of schwag when it comes to online events!
											</br></br>
											<h2> Github Campus Expert</h2>
											Github employees train applicants in the domains of public speaking, technical writing, community leadership and software development. <a href="https://education.github.com/experts">This program</a> allows individuals to participate in exclusive events, support and guide college-centric developer communities.
											</br></br>
											<h2>GeeksforGeeks</h2>
											<blockquote>“Let the Geek inside you transpire”.</blockquote>
											The <a href="Campus Geeks Connect">Campus Geeks Connect</a> is a collaborative platform for student tech-enthusiasts and those who actively take part in programming activities at the college-level . Being one of the largest placement preparation portal for software job aspirants, the <a href="http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/campus-ambassador-program-by-geeksforgeeks/">campus ambassador</a> role requires one to organise contests, set up meet-ups and contribute to interview-based technical articles. Stipends, experience certificates and LinkedIn recommendations are additional benefits of such a program.
											</br></br>
											<h2>CodeChef</h2>
											Launched by Directi, CodeChef is a widely used online programming platform when it comes to competitive coding; it supports over 50 programming languages. Chapter Representatives carry out regular meet-ups, group discussions, workshops, speaker sessions and contests hosted on CodeChef. Collaborative online events are largely supported by CodeChef. Incase your campus doesn’t have a chapter, do <a href="https://www.codechef.com/campus_chapter/register">register</a> for the same!

											<h2>LinkedIn</h2>
											The <a href="https://students.linkedin.com/student-publishing/campus-editor-program">Global Campus Editor Program</a> is for undergrad students who are passionate about writing and editing, finding <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/feed/channel/studentvoices">#StudentVoices</a>, and supporting peers in developing and expressing their ideas. If you’re a zealous writer with a flair for writing technical content on professional publishing platforms like LinkedIn, this program is apt. You are required to motivate your peers and content writers on campus, to contribute to the same. Go ahead- gain recognition via your articles!
											</br>
											<h2>HackerEarth</h2>
											The <a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/university/">HackerEarth University Program</a> provides a medium via which impassioned and driven students form programming clubs or communities in their respective colleges. In addition to having a good technical skillset, the representative should be a leader in the sense that he or she should host online coding contests and hackathons. Free passes toHackerEarth events and loads of goodies are bonuses!
											</br></br>
											<h2>Mozilla</h2>
											<blockquote>“Mozilla’s mission is to ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all”.</blockquote>
											The <a href="https://campus.mozilla.community/">Firefox Student Ambassadors Program</a> has migrated into Mozilla Campus Clubs. Such clubs encourage avid coders and developers to meet up and innovate on open source projects that keep the web open.
											</br></br>
											<h2>TechGig</h2>
											Synonymous with the roles of the GeeksforGeeks and HackerRank campus ambassadors, the <a href="https://www.techgig.com/campus-ambassador">TechGig Campus Ambassador Program</a> selects keen individuals who can build a strong technical group. The ambassador has to participate in TechGig’s Biggest Recruitment Drive, Code Wizards, and gets paid internship opportunities with companies hiring on TechGig. Pre-placement challenges are trademarks of this program
											</br></br>
											<h2> University Innovation Fellows Program</h2>
											This <a href="http://universityinnovationfellows.org/about-us/program/">global program</a> empowers students to become agents of change in higher education and is open to students from the freshman year to PhD. Fellows make certain that their peers and communities gain the required attitudes, skills and knowledge to compete in the economy of the future.
