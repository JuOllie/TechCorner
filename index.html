											<h2>An IISc Lecture: Deep Learning Research- Representation Learning</h2>
											In his hour long lecture pertaining to cutting-edge research in deep learning(DL), Professor Sargur Narasimhamurthy Srihari touched upon various topics including the significance of representation, representation learning methods, transfer learning, disentangling variables and explainable artificial intelligence (AI). Prof. Srihari is a SUNY Distinguished Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University at Buffalo. I strive to highlight important points of the session.

											<h2>Graph Convolutional Neural Networks- A Talk at IISc</h2>
											Being an intern at IISc has its own perks, one of them being the talks given by researchers in trending technological domains. I was fortunate to attend a talk recently, organised by the IEEE Signal Processing Society, Bangalore Chapter and the Electrical Engineering department at IISc. Current CTO of mind.ai and a former graduate from Geoff Hinton’s lab (University of Toronto), Dr. Tijmen Tieleman introduced us to the concept of graph convolutional neural networks within an hour! I’ve tried to pen down the remnants of the session, from my perspective. This one’s for the AI & Deep Learning enthusiasts.

											<h2>A Beginner’s Guide to Installing OpenCV Android in Android Studio</h2>
											Albeit the plethora of resources and documentation pertaining to OpenCV and OpenCV Android, I’ve yet to come across an article which correctly explains something as simple as the integration of OpenCV Android with Android Studio systematically, for newbies. Hence the motive behind compiling such an article. The OpenCV library is aimed at implementing Image Processing and Computer Vision functionalities in real time applications. Yes-it’s open source and it was originally written in C++. You’d be amazed at the ways in which such a library could come handy, especially during a hackathon! </br>

											<h2>The Emperor of All Maladies- Meet ‘Cancer’ in Person</h2>
											The first week of my freshman year at college was marked by a book which was an eyeopener to me. The following is a culmination of both, my understanding of Cancer and a review of Siddhartha Mukherjee’s spellbinding masterpiece.Penetrating various strata of society, targeting all age groups, victimizing individuals and tormenting families, ‘Cancer’ is a mutated vice that was, is and will continue to be. In his 472 paged chronicle, Siddhartha Mukherjee, an erudite oncologist (alumnus of Stanford, Harvard and Oxford Medical colleges) immunologist and physician, aptly personifies Cancer in its true, diabolically vicious form with the much needed professional insensitivity and detachment of a doctor.

											<h2>Yikes! It’s the Research Bogeyman</h2>
											Learnt a new technical tool or software recently? Let’s use it to work on a small data-set or implement a mini-project.Why not publish it, by using flowery language, resplendent images, a couple of haphazardly chosen citations and some jargon, overnight? Viola! You have one of the shallowest papers in terms of depth, analysis and content. <i>There is no gainsaying the fact that ‘Research’ is a LOT more than just publishing a paper or two by mere implementation, via a technological tool</i>. It doesn’t happen overnight and deadlines are never concrete, nothing is immutable or foreseeable at times. Here’s why I’m writing this one- because I’ve done it too. Here are some resources and tips that could help you sail through your research ventures as an undergrad.

											<h2>Avail, Apply and Ace</h2>
											Having worked with various college-level technical communities and groups, it’s common to come across scenarios where individuals lose out on applications, scholarships and event registrations. You must be wondering why. Well, it’s the ‘I didn’t know’ Syndrome. Being a part of technical groups as an undergrad student has it’s own perks (a lot of them, actually). This article aims at covering a few, to leverage you to utilise community resources optimally.

											<h2>A Glimpse into Various Campus Ambassador Programs</h2>
											Think you have a few hours to contribute to programs outside college? Being a campus ambassador or a campus expert is the best way to help your college communities in addition to building connections and enriching your skill-set. Such groups are very supportive- starting from resources to sponsoring events! Having been a GeeksforGeeks Campus Ambassador for my college, I was a part of a super friendly and interactive community with encouraging mentors. I've a curated list of few campus ambassador programs that you could apply for.
