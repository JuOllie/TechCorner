											<h1>The Emperor of All Maladies- Meet ‘Cancer’ in Person</h1>
										</header>

										
											<p>The first week of my freshman year at college was marked by a book which was an eyeopener to me. The following is a culmination of both, my understanding of Cancer and a review of Siddhartha Mukherjee’s spellbinding masterpiece. </p>

											Penetrating various strata of society, targeting all age groups, victimizing individuals and tormenting families, ‘Cancer’ is a mutated vice that was, is and will continue to be. In his 472 paged chronicle, <i>Siddhartha Mukherjee</i>, an erudite oncologist (alumnus of Stanford, Harvard and Oxford Medical colleges) immunologist and physician, aptly personifies Cancer in its true, diabolically vicious form with the much needed professional insensitivity and detachment of a doctor. He records its historical aspects (war on Cancer- by Sidney Farber and Mary Lasker, Halsted, Freireich and Frei) including the meticulous and brutal methodology of treatment and intricacies of the same (radiology and chemotherapy versus mutilating, decimating and amputating surgery) — with the eye of a historian and the frenzy of a biographer. Apart from taking us to the roots of Cancer via certain selected cases and highlighting the complexities of a patient-doctor relationship,<i> ‘The Emperor of All Maladies’ serves as general ‘Book on Cancer’ for the common mass </i>, written because of a ‘need’ rather than a ‘want’. </br></br>

											<h2>Behavioral Demystification of Cancer –Metastatic Hyperplasia at its zenith, a Battle with Oneself</h2>
											<blockquote>“Cancer was not disorganized chromosomal chaos. It was organized chromosomal chaos” — Siddhartha Mukherjee</blockquote> </br>

											Paradoxical in nature, this ‘doppelganger’ is a specific and non-specific, proliferated, evolved, distorted, adaptive and advanced mirror-image of our very own self. Both, the patient and the doctor are mutually drawn into an unfathomable void mentally-catastrophe feared, despair predominating hope and perseverance being the only form of solace. Mukherjee explains various tests and trials over the years that have led to both the determination and elimination of the umpteen number of causes- carcinogen exposure, age and pathological causes , to name a few.

											<p>But the crux of the severity lies in one fact- <i>Cancer keeps evolving as we do (probably faster) , adapts to a particular kind of treatment and a single type of Cancer has multiple gene mutations with no stereotypical or generalized treatment to target each one at the cellular level</i>. It maybe local or wide-spread, often depending on the stage of the patient. There is no 100% cure due relapses and the exponential cellular multiplication calls for regular treatment. What is more startling is the fact that the site of invasion is unpredictable- A mere breast cancer can invade the liver and the entire esophageal track!</p> 

											<h2>Cancer over the Generations</h2>
											<blockquote>“ I’m willing to go on, but before I go on, I need to know what it is I’m battling” -Carla Reed</blockquote>

											<p>Carla Reed, a thirty year old school teacher is pivotal to the story; her personal experiences are juxtaposed to the general perception of Cancer. Starting his trail from the Dana Farber Cancer Research Institute to the Massachusetts General Hospital (including the NCI, Mary Lasker’s apartment,Boston Children’s Hospital), Mukherjee unveils the generation-wise transformation of medical and social ideologies regarding Cancer. The saga of this ironically self-induced beast narrates its detection followed by identification and attempts made at elimination or temporary suppression (combinations and permutations of toxins, usage of dyes, folic acid derivative- Aminopterin, lumpectomy, MOPP and VAMP regimens- to name a few). All of these stand witness to the fact that crude imagery characterizes this macabre. Some of the types of cancer mentioned include Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia , Sarcoma, Neuroblastoma, Lymphoma, prostrate cancer, breast cancer and Chondrocarcinoma. The book revolves around investigators, researchers, political entities, activists (Laskerites) and various organizations apart from the central doctor-patient theme.</p>

											<p>Will questions regarding ‘Cancer’ ever be answered? Will there ever be a cure? Is the government effectively funding any Cancer-related causes with ample sums? Can Cancer be eradicated? And most importantly- are we, the general people aware? Read on to find out how the protagonist and antagonist reside and refer to the very same form!</p>
